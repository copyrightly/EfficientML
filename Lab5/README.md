The main part is to accelerate matrix multiplication through loop unrolling, SIMD and multithreading.

To reproduce the work:
- `git clone --recursive https://github.com/mit-han-lab/tinychat-tutorial`
- finish the TODO in [these files](https://github.com/copyrightly/EfficientML/tree/main/Lab5/tinychat-tutorial/kernels/starter_code)
- test implementation by running `./evaluate.sh`
- the step above also generate an executable named `chat`, which you can run to deploy a local chatbot with the specific implementation. To play with the local chatbot: `./chat`.
